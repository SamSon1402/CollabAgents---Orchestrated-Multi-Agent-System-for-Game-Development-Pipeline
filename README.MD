## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Specialized Agent Ecosystem

- **🎨 Design Agent**: Analyzes game design documents to generate concept art and level layouts
  - Utilizes RAG to maintain design consistency with existing game assets
  - Produces visual outputs that adhere to established art direction
  
- **📝 Script Agent**: Creates character dialogue and storylines that align with game lore
  - Generates contextually appropriate dialogue trees with emotional variations
  - Maintains narrative consistency across different game scenarios
  
- **🕹️ Test Agent**: Simulates diverse player behaviors to identify bugs and balance issues
  - Implements multiple playstyles to comprehensively test game mechanics
  - Generates detailed reports highlighting potential issues and suggested solutions
  
- **🎭 Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates communication and task allocation between agents
  - Manages workflow dependencies and prioritization
  - Resolves conflicts between agent outputs and maintains system coherence

### 🤝 Human-AI Collaboration Framework

- Natural language interface for non-technical team members to guide agent behavior
- Real-time feedback incorporation system with intuitive approval/revision workflow
- Context-aware agent responses that adapt to team preferences over time
- Seamless handoff between human and agent tasks during development cycles

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture

- Agent communication protocol preventing hallucination propagation between agents
- Kubernetes-based deployment for scalable performance across multiple projects
- Persistent memory system using RAG to maintain project context across sessions
- Modular design allowing for easy addition of new specialized agents

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Core Framework**: Python 3.9+
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Knowledge Management**: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), Vector Databases
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Testing**: Pytest, Hypothesis
- **Documentation**: Sphinx, MkDocs

## 🏆 Case Study: Project "Nebula Horizon"

CollabAgents was deployed on the development of "Nebula Horizon," an open-world space exploration game:

- Reduced concept art iteration cycles from 5 days to 1.5 days
- Generated 12,000+ lines of contextually appropriate dialogue for 42 NPCs
- Identified 217 critical gameplay balance issues that would have been missed in traditional testing
- Enabled small indie team (6 people) to produce AAA-quality content

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/collabagents.git
cd collabagents

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up configuration
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your API keys and preferences

# Run the orchestrator
python src/orchestrator.py
```

## 🚢 Kubernetes Deployment

CollabAgents is designed for scalable deployment in Kubernetes environments:

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t collabagents:latest .

# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
```

## 📖 Usage Example

```python
from collabagents import Orchestrator
from collabagents.agents import DesignAgent, ScriptAgent, TestAgent

# Initialize the orchestrator with specialized agents
orchestrator = Orchestrator(
    design_agent=DesignAgent(),
    script_agent=ScriptAgent(),
    test_agent=TestAgent(),
    project_config="projects/nebula_horizon.yaml"
)

# Start a collaborative design session
session = orchestrator.create_session(
    session_type="concept_development",
    human_team=["art_director", "lead_designer"],
    context="sci-fi desert planet environment with ancient ruins"
)

# Generate design concepts
concepts = session.generate_concepts(
    quantity=5,
    style_references=["path/to/reference1.jpg", "path/to/reference2.jpg"],
    constraints={"color_palette": "warm", "mood": "mysterious"}
)

# Review and refine with human feedback
refined_concept = session.refine_concept(
    concept_id=concepts[2].id,
    feedback="Make the ruins appear more alien and less earth-like"
)

# Export final assets
session.export_assets(
    output_dir="project_assets/environments/desert_planet/",
    formats=["png", "fbx", "unreal"]
)
```

## 🔮 Future Development
